      mission_description_1: As our name suggests, collaboration has always been at the heart of our mission. We truly believe that by working together, we are all stronger.
      mission_description_2: Our goal is to gather around CollabMachine both the largest number of specialists and the most varied skills in computer science, e-commerce and web marketing in order to become the site par excellence for obtaining timely resources in Quebec and elsewhere.
      mission_description_3: "In this period of labour shortage, we look for the specialists where they are: in the companies. They get new mandates and we can offer the best talents."
      info_description_1: A small revolution!
      info_description_2: <strong>Want to get a resource that specializes in web marketing, e-commerce or IT</strong>? Just choose the specialty you want. There is no upfront fee. If you work with the chosen specialist, you will have to pay his services + $350 per week for our services. That's it. When the specialist's work is completed, there are no more fees. Simple, easy and with no initial or long-term commitment.
      info_description_3: <strong>You want to realize a project in web marketing, e-commerce or IT</strong>? Vous n’avez qu’à déposer un projet. Since many IT projects have a marketing component (and vice versa), we offer to carry out your projects by selected specialists in 360° mode so that your projects are deployed in a sales tunnel that is perfectly integrated with your operations. For a turnkey project, at a fixed cost and without surprises, CollabMachine is the only place to know.
