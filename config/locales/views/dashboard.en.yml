      short_desc1_ecuador: The aim of the foundation is to offer our help and support to communities with poor economic resources in Ecuador. We do this through donations, and by sharing knowledge and expertise about development and social aid through the Spanish teaching.
      short_desc2_ecuador: Sintaxis Spanish Language School Sintaxis was founded in order to achieve this goal. Through the Language School, we offer Spanish teaching for students of all nationalities. Through our social aid work with several partner projects, we can offer additional services to our students, such as volunteer opportunities. This also offers additional training and practice in the Spanish language, and it is a great benefit for all of us.
