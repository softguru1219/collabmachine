# Production Database Setup

- within the appropriate Google Cloud Platform project, create a new Cloud SQL Instance
  - Postgres 13
  - 1 vCPU
  - 10GB
  - SSD
  - âœ… automated backups
  - Montreal Data Centre
  - (record the password)
- Under Connections > Networking whitelist the IP's for
  - developers' home networks
  - the production app server
- SSL?
- Under Users, add a user account called `app_server` & record the password
- connect to the administrative database (`postgres`) using PSQL:
`psql postgres://app_server:<pass>@<ip>/postgres`
- `create database <dbname>;`
- On the app server, use rails console to test connection with database server:
```
conn =  PG.connect(
  host: "<host>",
  port: "5432",
  dbname: "postgres",
  user: "app_server",
  password: "<pass>"
)
conn.exec("select datname from pg_database;").to_a
```

## Migration
- shut down production app server
- dump old prod database:
`pg_dump --file="tmp/collab_prod_2021_08_09.sql" --no-privileges --no-owner postgres://<user>:<pass>@oregon-postgres.render.com/<dbname>`
- get rowcounts of old prod database
- connect to new prod database server with `psql`:
`psql postgres://app_server:<pass>@<ip>/<dbname>`
- set stop on error: `\set ON_ERROR_STOP true`
- import the dump: `\i tmp/collab_prod_2021_08_09.sql`
- verify rowcounts of new prod database
- modify database.yml on prod server
- verify that it works in rails console
- restart server
